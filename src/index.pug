            h2 What is JAMHacks?
            p JAMHacks 2 will be Waterloo's biggest high school hackathon yet! On April 14-15, we are bringing together 200 students from high schools all over Ontario for a full weekend of learning, creating and innovating. Participants ("hackers") will get the entire 24 hours to invent and build a software or hardware project, and then show it off to a panel of judges as well as their fellow hackers.
            p As a high school hackathon, our mission is to inspire more high school students to explore and pursue truly innovative projects and careers in technology. With your help, we can show them firsthand why Waterloo is internationally recognized for innovation.

          h2 Past Events
          p In April 2017, we hosted JAMHacks, Waterloo's first hackathon organized entirely by high school students, for high school students. Over 100 students, some from as far as Toronto, Mississauga and Windsor, came out for the 12-hour event. Even in such a short amount of time, our hackers created a wide array of impressive projects, such as a #[a(href="https://devpost.com/software/e-tabula") light-up chessboard].

          h3 Mentors
          p A mentor is a great way to interact with and gain recognition among hackers. The people and companies that will be remembered most by hackers will be those who helped them through any roadblocks and bugs they encounter, and guided them to success.
          h3 Sponsor Booth
          p Your booth is your company's physical representation at our hackathon. We recommend that you send at least one representative (mentor/evangelist) from your company who can tell hackers about your company and answer their questions. To best utilize your space, we recommend providing swag (pens, notepads, stickers, stress balls, t-shirts, etc.) for attendees to pick up when they visit your booth.
          h3 Company Judge
          p You or a representative from your company will have the opportunity to see all of the projects and help select the winners (including the winner of your custom award if you choose to provide one)! We recommend that judges have some background in technology or entrepreneurship to provide the best possible judging for our event.
          h3 Workshop
          p By hosting a workshop or "tech talk", you can educate our hackers and promote your company's image at the same time! You could teach hackers how to use your product, teach a general skill, or discuss technology or entrepreneurship.
          h3 Custom Award
          p This could be an API prize ("Best use of [Your API]"), or it could be a more general prize, like "Best Hardware Hack" or "Best Environmental Impact Hack". You will provide the reward but we will credit the value of your reward (cash value or equivalent retail value) towards your sponsorship contribution, up to a maximum of $500. If you wish to provide an intangible reward, we can discuss how to credit it towards your sponsorship.
        section#contact
          h2 Interested?
          p Send us an email at #[+mailto("sponsor@jamhacks.ca")]. All sponsorships are negotiable and we would be more than happy to discuss details, or work out a custom sponsorship opportunity for you!
